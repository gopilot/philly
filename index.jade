                    p #{title} is a <a href="http://gopilot.org">Pilot</a>-run event. Pilot is a national organization that holds hands-on educational events for high school students. Students form teams, brainstorm ideas, work together to bring one of those ideas to life with technology, and then demo and pitch the apps/websites they created for awards and prizes. We engage the local community by bringing in engineers and designers who mentor these students over the course of a day and help them bring their ideas to life.

                    p Through this process students learn how to think creatively, pitch and demo their projects, and more technical skills like how to code and design. Most importantly, they learn how to learn.

            .box.copy.slate.span-9.mobile-full
                h5 Do I need previous coding experience?
                p
                    strong Nope! 
                    | The point of the event is to learn. If you want to build a real app that you and others can use in real life, then this event is for you.

                h5 Who can participate?
                p Pilot events are for all high school students! Coding experience is not required. You aren't required to have ever built an app before; we will have workshops to help you ramp up quickly. You can come with a team or come alone - there will be a place for you.

                h5 What should I bring?
                p Laptop and charger, extension cord, cellphone and charger, photo ID, and whatever else you need to build your project.

                h5 How many people per team?
                p You can have a maximum of <strong>four (4) students</strong> on your team.

                h5 Can I start working before #{title}?
                p <strong>No.</strong> Contestants are not allowed to work on their apps prior to the event. If you want to prepare for the event, focus on gaining experience with and knowledge of the tool you hope to use to build your application.

                h5 Do I need a team or idea to sign up?
                p Nope! We will have sessions to help people find team members and/or form teams, as well as an idea generation workshop to help people think of ideas to work on for the event. So you should sign up regardless!

                h5 Do I have to be there the entire time?
                p Once you arrive, for safety reasons, you will not be allowed to leave until the end of the event.

                h5 Will there be food?
                p Yes. The only thing you need to worry about is building your app; let us take care of the rest. Lunch, dinner, snacks, and plenty of drinks will be provided throughout the competition at no cost to participants. We will be providing vegetarian options as well. If you have a specific food allergy or other specific need, contact us and we'll try to find a way to make it work for you. Breakfast will not be provided, so please eat before arriving!

                h5 What should I wear?
                p While there are no strict guidelines on how to dress, clothing has a profound <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112000200">effect on the wearer's psychological processes</a>. If you look good, you end up doing better work. We’ll also have a photographer present throughout the event, so you all might want to look sharp.

                h5 What if I have a question that's not here?
                    p We'd love to help answer it for you! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:fly@gopilot.org">fly@gopilot.org</a> with your question, and we'll get back to you within 24 hours.
